# Welcome to Transitional Apps

Classic server-rendered websites are simple and work well for content rich pages that don't need a lot of interactivity. By contrast Single Page Applications (SPA) or Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are an excellent option for applications that require a high-level of interactivity and can sacrifice the simplicity, SEO, and initial page load speed of classic websites, a classic example being gmail.

In reality, many websites fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. Having a mix of both content heavy pages and sections of high interactivity. That is where transitional apps shine. With the ability to *transition* between server-rendered pages and a javascript powered front-end as you navigate through a website it provides the best of both worlds.
